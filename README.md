# Chatroom
This app allows you to chat with others through sockets. It uses the Phoenix framework. This is an updated version of the popular tutorial found here (as of 1/9/25): https://shyr.io/blog/simple-chat-phoenix-elixir
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
